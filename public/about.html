<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Jishnu—a recruiter, entrepreneur, and technology enthusiast passionate about solving real-world problems 
  through innovation and collaboration. With a background in talent acquisition spanning both agency and in-house roles, 
  I’ve honed my skills in sourcing top talent and building diverse, inclusive teams.</p>

<p>As the co-founder of Tenanto, a tech platform reimagining the rental experience, I strive to create solutions that simplify 
  the lives of tenants, landlords, and property managers. My entrepreneurial journey has taught me the value of adaptability, 
  persistence, and customer-centric thinking</p>

<p>Outside of work, I’m an advocate for equality and inclusion, actively supporting initiatives to empower women and sexual 
  minorities in the workforce. I’m also deeply passionate about science, humanism, and the transformative potential of technology.</p>

  <p>Whether I’m refining hiring strategies, building a product roadmap, or mentoring others, my goal remains the same: to create meaningful, 
    lasting impact.</p>

    <p>Let’s connect and build something amazing together!</p>
